   Oviax1 is a software created by JAVA that in first version. It's dedicated to convert formatted photo files such as JPEG / PNG to symbols based photos(articulating later) on console. It's powerful in showing a photo on your GUI but confined by the language or other factors which you couldn't display on the console.

   - 3.1 Introduce to developer
     - 3.1.0 First developer: Zhongxuan(Daniel) Wang.
     Oviax is originally started by Zhongxuan(Daniel) Wang, which is me. I'm learning at Saint Andrew's School as an international student. I'm from China, but I tried not to write Chinese as denotations or even readme. The time when I started the project was grade 9. Java is the second object-oriented language that I learnt and applied to real situations. My personal email is 'cndanielwang@gmail.com' (without single quote).
