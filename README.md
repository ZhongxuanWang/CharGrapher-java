**********************
*In oder to use all the functions in, it is expected to:<br>

2> After doing so, install 'opencv-python' by inputting '<code>pip3 install opencv-python</code>' in Terminal and hitting Enter.<br>
3> Have the latest JDK and JVM (<a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/mac_download.jsp">download latest Java for MacOS</a>).<br>
4> **Use the camera mode in a brighter environment is recommended** since it will be easier to distinguish your face or certain objects from the background<br>
